this was setup to run a React app with a typescript template by navivating into this directory then running 
npx create-react-app . --template typescript
modify as you see fit as the command adds its dependancies to package.json

additionally the run scripts found in package .json are defaulted to the bellow
  "start": "react-scripts start",
  "build": "react-scripts build",
  "test": "react-scripts test",
  "eject": "react-scripts eject"
modify if nessasary

The other README.md was autogenerated by the react install
